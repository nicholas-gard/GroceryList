# GroceryList
Assignment, Module 8

1. This project was our final one for programming languages and helped make it easy to count items in a text file. Its is able to read a file, count the grocery items and display them in multiple ways.
2. I did a good job of utilizing more complicated programming tools to complete this project. Maps were initially confusing to me but I was able to figure them out and apply them to this project.
3. I would enhance my code by writing with classes in mind first. I didn't see the necessity for a class in this project initially but as it went along I realized how it would make the code more readable. Along with providing more options to the user for updating items.
4. The most challenging part for me was counting all the items. I tried many different ways to count them effecctively but settled on a map. The value pairs were really useful but I still had a hard time adjusting the for loops to count each item.
5. Dealing with files is something I'm sure will help a lot in the future. Most large projects are divided into many file to maintain readability and efficieny. Learning how to manipulate them in c++ will be very helpful.
6. I made this program readable by following industry standard best practices. All relavent variable names and functions were easy to understand or read from the name alone. I also added frequent comments to explain my code and what it does.
